# File-Portal-RTC
A simple WebRTC based file transfer tool inspired by my Java-based repository: [File-Portal](https://github.com/albertbregonia/file-portal)

This version is much simpler than File-Portal and the entire system is embedded into a single HTML file that is generated by `compile.py`. For the sake of development, the HTML/CSS/JS are shown as separate files in this repository. `compile.py` also removes excess whitespace in the generated `file-transfer.html` file

## How to Use:
***Transfers are limited to only ONE file at a time! However, the HTML file can be opened up in multiple tabs to transfer multiple files at a time.***

*Both peers must download the `file-transfer.html` and open it in their favorite [WebRTC capable browser](https://caniuse.com/?search=webrtc).*

*The UI is merely the base64 encoded version of WebRTC's offer-answer model.*

1. Select whether you are going to be sending or receiving files by pressing the respective button.
    - This step is only important for establishing the initial connection.
    - Once the connection is established **both** parties will be able to send/receive files.
2. Follow the prompts described by the JavaScript `alert()`s.
